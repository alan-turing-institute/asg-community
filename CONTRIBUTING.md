# How to contribute?

First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute to the [AI for Science and Government (ASG)](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/asg) Community and Collaboration Initiative! üéâ

The goal of the ASG Community and Collaboration initiative is to collaboratively write three whitepapers reporting on three cross-theme projects and supporting communications materials.
This is a community effort and we welcome all ASG researchers as contributors to all the communications outputs. 

This GitHub repository is a place to share resources for the ASG researchers interested in learning about and contributing to the ASG white papers and communication outputs.
All contributions and suggestions to the white paper project as well as community activities are invited, especially drawing from the projects you lead or participate in.
Whatever your interest and availability, there is a way to contribute to this GitHub repository.

As an open source repository, we also encourage anyone reading this repository to report mistakes and errors, propose changes in our existing resources or suggest new resources.
