# Onboarding Contributors to the ASG Community and White Paper project

The vision of this project is to _Demonstrate, showcase and amplify the real-world impact of ASG research._

ASG researchers will collaborate, exchange knowledge and showcase their work through their involvement in the ASG community and white paper project.
The goal is to collaboratively develop a series of white papers as well as supporting communication outputs highlighting ASG research.
In this document, we provide list of information and resources available for all contributors to the ASG white papers.

## Get in touch with the project team

As a community-led project, there are several contributors to this project (see: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/asg-community#who-is-involved).
For onboarding and other questions related to this project, you can directly reach out to the Community Manager by emailing `arao@turing.ac.uk`, or contact via Slack.
You can also create [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/asg-community/issues/new) if you would like to discuss your idea openly on this repository.

## Long list of projects

The ASG Community Manager has compiled a long list of a project curated by ASG project leads and Research Application Managers. 
Please browse through the information provided in this document (READ ONLY): [Link to be added by Achintya].

This document provides a summary of each project, researchers involved in those projects, relevant links/resources, specific cross-theme project/white paper where those projects can be highlighted and current contributors to the ASG white paper involved in writing about them.
This is a good place to start as you can get an overview of what projects are being considered to be highlighted in the white papers and which project you would like to write about or review (you don't have to be personally leading those projects).
If an ASG project you worked on is not currently listed that you would like to write about, please create an issue and start discussing it, or get in touch with the project team members (previous section).

## Access to different communications platforms

Please read the [contributing guideline](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to understand how you can get involved in the project.
All contributors will be given access to the following platforms:

### GitHub project repository
- ‚õ≤Ô∏è This repo is **_public_** where all community and project management-related information will be stored.
- See [Project board](https://github.com/orgs/alan-turing-institute/projects/10/) for current issues and Pull Requests.

### Overleaf
- üöß We use Overleaf as the authoring platform and access is enabled by invitation

### Slack for  general day-to-day communications
- üîê Access to all of Turing by default; external contributors by invitation
- Main channel: [#asg-white-papers](https://alan-turing-institute.slack.com/messages/asg-white-papers). Specific channels for each white paper are listed in the resource table

## Authorship and Acknowledgement

All contributors to this project will be listed as an author and acknowledged fairly for their contributions. 
We are using an extension of the [CRediT ‚Äì Contributor Roles Taxonomy](https://casrai.org/credit/), which is a high-level taxonomy, including many roles ASG community members can take throughout their participation in the co-creation of the ASG white papers as well as related communication outputs. 

Please read the [contributor roles](documentation/asg-white-papers/contributor-roles.md) to understand the scope of authorship beyond writing and reviewing.
For any suggestion, concern or clarification, please create an issue on this repository or reach out to the project team.

## Structure of White Papers

Each white paper will include the following sections:

1. Executive Summary
1. Introduction (broad overview of the problem area)
1. Challenges (areas that the paper will address)
1. ASG Contributions (ASG research projects) 
1. Recommendations (for the wider research community, policymakers, industry and government)
1. Conclusion (meta-narrative)
1. Acknowledgement

### Contributing via Overleaf

All drafts will be collaboratively developed via Overleaf where dedicated projects have been set up for each white paper.
All contributions will be managed by the Community Manager who will coordinate the drafts for each section.

- Each section of the document sits in a separate file (which can be found on the left side in Overleaf).
  The sections are **for guidance only** and can be changed as needed.
  Please feel free to edit the document and add/change sections.
- Each section is contained in a **markdown** file.
  It‚Äôs mostly plain text with a little markup for bold, italics, links, bullets etc.
  No fancy $\LaTeX$ is required.
- For the sake of meaningful `diff`s between versions of the document, please start a new sentence on a new line.
  This practice is sometimes called using ‚Äúsemantic line breaks‚Äù.
  Find out more: <https://sembr.org/>.
- Overleaf offers to comment and change-tracking (the latter is not active by default).
  Highlighting any text in the source file gives you an option to add a comment.
- Every time you save the file, it recompiles the PDF.

Please [see the template documents for details](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/asg-community/tree/main/documentation/asg-white-papers/white-paper-template).
Contact [Achintya Rao](https://github.com/RaoOfPhysics) if you need help with formatting.
